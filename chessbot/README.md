This is my first chess bot ._. 

I have always thought improving at chess should include understanding the game without seeing the pieces. My first iteration of this chess bot will be a command line program that returns the previous moves played in chess notation. It will also return random moves currently so good luck beating it! 

The next one will not be so easy !!

## How to Run

**Windows:** Double-click `run.bat` or run `run.bat` from command prompt

**Mac/Linux:** Run `chmod +x run.sh` (first time), then `./run.sh`

## How to Play

Choose your color (white or black) and enter moves in algebraic notation like `e4`, `Nf3`, `O-O`, etc. The engine will respond with its move. Type `exit` to quit.

## Features

- Board displays from your perspective
- Standard algebraic notation for moves
- Random engine moves (for now!)
